Software Architecture Principles and Patterns

Software architecture is the high-level structure of a software system, defining the organization of components and their relationships. Good architecture is crucial for maintainability, scalability, and reliability.

SOLID Principles:
- Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change
- Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution Principle: Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes
- Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use
- Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

Common Architectural Patterns:

Layered Architecture:
- Presentation Layer: User interface and user interaction
- Business Layer: Business logic and rules
- Data Access Layer: Database operations and data persistence
- Benefits: Separation of concerns, testability, maintainability

Microservices Architecture:
- Decompose applications into small, independent services
- Each service owns its data and business logic
- Communicate via APIs (REST, GraphQL, messaging)
- Benefits: Scalability, technology diversity, fault isolation
- Challenges: Distributed system complexity, data consistency

Event-Driven Architecture:
- Components communicate through events
- Loose coupling between producers and consumers
- Supports real-time processing and reactive systems
- Common patterns: Pub/Sub, Event Sourcing, CQRS

Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters):
- Business logic at the center, isolated from external concerns
- Ports define interfaces, adapters implement them
- Enables easy testing and technology swapping
- Promotes dependency inversion

Clean Architecture:
- Concentric circles of dependencies
- Inner layers independent of outer layers
- Framework and database are details, not core
- Emphasizes testability and maintainability
