# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems

RAG combines information retrieval with text generation to provide more accurate and contextual responses. It's a powerful technique that enhances large language models by giving them access to external knowledge bases.

## How RAG Works

1. **Document Ingestion**: Documents are processed, chunked, and converted into vector embeddings
2. **Storage**: Embeddings are stored in a vector database for efficient similarity search
3. **Retrieval**: When a query is received, relevant documents are retrieved based on semantic similarity
4. **Generation**: The retrieved context is combined with the query and fed to a language model for response generation

## Key Components

### Vector Embeddings
- Convert text into numerical representations that capture semantic meaning
- Enable similarity search across large document collections
- Common models: OpenAI embeddings, Sentence-BERT, E5

### Vector Stores
- Specialized databases for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors
- Examples: Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, FAISS
- Support for metadata filtering and hybrid search

### Chunking Strategies
- **Fixed-size chunking**: Split documents into equal-sized segments
- **Semantic chunking**: Break text at natural boundaries (sentences, paragraphs)
- **Overlapping windows**: Maintain context across chunk boundaries

## Benefits of RAG

- **Up-to-date Information**: Access to current data not in the model's training set
- **Domain Expertise**: Incorporate specialized knowledge bases
- **Reduced Hallucination**: Ground responses in factual source material
- **Transparency**: Ability to cite sources and explain reasoning
- **Cost Efficiency**: Avoid fine-tuning large models for domain-specific tasks
