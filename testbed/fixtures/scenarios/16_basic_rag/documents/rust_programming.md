# Rust Programming Language

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. It was originally developed by Mozilla Research and is now maintained by the Rust Foundation.

## Key Features

- **Memory Safety**: Rust prevents common programming errors like null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and memory leaks without requiring a garbage collector.
- **Zero-cost Abstractions**: You can use high-level features without sacrificing performance.
- **Ownership System**: Rust's unique ownership model ensures memory safety and prevents data races at compile time.
- **Pattern Matching**: Powerful pattern matching with the `match` expression allows for expressive and safe code.
- **Trait System**: Similar to interfaces in other languages, traits define shared behavior across types.

## Common Use Cases

Rust is excellent for:
- System programming (operating systems, embedded systems)
- Web backends and APIs
- Network services and microservices
- Command-line tools
- WebAssembly applications
- Blockchain and cryptocurrency projects

## Getting Started

To install Rust, use rustup:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Create a new project with Cargo:
```bash
cargo new hello_world
cd hello_world
cargo run
```
